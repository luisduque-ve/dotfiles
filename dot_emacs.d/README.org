#+TITLE: Emacs config
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle init.el

This is my personal Emacs configuration. I try to keep it simple while using as
much of evil-mode as possible.

Since this is tracked by Chezmoi, you don't need to modify this file on fresh
installs.

To regenerate the init.el file, simply go to the top of this file (inside
Emacs, of course) and press C-c C-c. After that, run org-babel-tangle.
